# desktop-ubuntu-arm-packaging

This repository handles the packaging steps for ARM 32-bit architecture of the
GitHub Desktop for Linux fork.

This is a standalone workflow to build any native dependencies against an older
version of glibc, without needing to restrict other tooling to older versions
of `glibc`, so that any native binaries have the broadest support across Linux
distributions.

Currently this uses Ubuntu 18.04 and Node 20.

with figuring out this approach within GitHub Actions.
